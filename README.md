# Web-Deisgn
## First web-design project
In this repository i created a local web-page for customer management relatioship. There's three unique views, employee who manages the customers and their interactions, manager who views each employee statistics and admin who can manage every user in the system.
The design of the base was inspired on some parts from my Figma Design ( which was something i also tried for first time ). The application doesn't handle scalability well yet, but on future improvements i will definetely implement those aswell.
